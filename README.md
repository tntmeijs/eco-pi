# Eco-Pi
Welcome to the Eco-Pi project! This project is used to parse the output from the smart meter in my house, and visualise the data.

Since my house uses the Landis + Gyr E350 (ZCF110) smart meter, this project will be fully focused on supporting just this one device.

I will implement the DSMR 4.2 protocol as defined here: https://www.netbeheernederland.nl/_upload/Files/Slimme_meter_15_32ffe3cc38.pdf
